#  Bias-Variance Trade-Off and Bayesian Regression – ML Assignment

This project explores **core Machine Learning concepts** including:
- **Bias-Variance Trade-Off**
- **Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation**
- **Bayesian Sequential Updates**
- **Kernel Regression & Regularization**

The experiments were implemented and visualized using **Google Colab notebooks**, with clear plots and explanations.



## ⚙ Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn** (for Ridge Regression)
- **Google Colab** for interactive exploration

##  Purpose
To demonstrate the impact of model complexity, regularization, and Bayesian methods on regression performance and predictive uncertainty.
